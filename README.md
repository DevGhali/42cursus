<h2 align="center">⭐️ Piscine Phase 🥋 - September 2022 ⭐️ </h2>
❗️ So in order to become a student at 42 you must pass the so-called "Piscine" phase (Piscine = French for swimming pool 🏊‍♂️) - ik weird right?, its exactly like being thrown in a swimming pool and your objective is to basically swim in the pool and keep up for a period of 4 weeks, in addition there are no teachers/tutors so you must "swim" on your own + of course you can get help from your fellow peers who are doing the Piscine with you.
</br>
❓ Soo hold on.... Piscine, Swimming pool, no teachers no nothing what are you talking about????
</br>
😁 Yeah i figured you'd ask the same questions i had at the beginning of the Piscine but trust me its an extraordinary experience so let me explain...
</br>
🅰️ "Swimming pool" is basically like an environment where you would be put in and thats where you are going to do all the : learning, attempting, maybe failing at some point and thats where you start engaging socially and start making friends to trade help and support. 
</br>
Now the "swimming" part of it is that you'd be given certain tasks on a PDF sheet where you have to complete and get evaluated on them. all the coding is done in C and Shell, no prior experience is required whatsoever the main idea is to develop a skill where you are not dependent on a teacher or a system of some sort. 
</br>
And of course you must pass the Piscine in order to become a student at 42.
